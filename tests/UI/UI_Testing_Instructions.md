# UI Testing Instructions

This document provides instructions for conducting user testing of the ADEPT AI Teaching Assistant application.

## Testing Materials

The following materials are provided for UI testing:

1. **UI_Testing_Checklist.md** - A comprehensive checklist of UI features to test
2. **UI_Testing_Script.md** - A step-by-step script for guiding testers through the application
3. **UI_Testing_Feedback_Form.md** - A form for testers to provide feedback
4. **UI_Testing_Results.md** - A template for documenting testing results

## Testing Process

### 1. Preparation

1. Ensure the latest version of the application is built and ready to run
2. Prepare the testing environment (computer, screen resolution, etc.)
3. Print or have digital copies of the testing materials ready

### 2. Conducting the Test

#### Self-Testing

1. Use the **UI_Testing_Checklist.md** to systematically test each aspect of the UI
2. Document your findings in the **UI_Testing_Results.md** file
3. Note any issues or inconsistencies found during testing

#### User Testing

1. Recruit testers with varying levels of technical expertise
2. Provide each tester with the **UI_Testing_Script.md** to guide them through the application
3. Ask testers to complete the **UI_Testing_Feedback_Form.md** after testing
4. Observe testers as they use the application and take notes on any difficulties they encounter

### 3. Analyzing Results

1. Compile the results from all testers
2. Identify common issues and patterns
3. Prioritize issues based on severity and frequency
4. Create a summary report of the testing results

### 4. Follow-Up

1. Address high-priority issues first
2. Plan for future improvements based on feedback
3. Consider conducting additional testing after making changes

## Testing Guidelines

### What to Look For

1. **Visual Consistency** - Are styles, colors, and layouts consistent throughout the application?
2. **Usability** - Is the application intuitive and easy to use?
3. **Responsiveness** - Does the UI adapt well to different window sizes?
4. **Accessibility** - Can the application be used with keyboard navigation and screen readers?
5. **Performance** - Are animations smooth? Does the UI respond quickly to user actions?

### How to Document Issues

For each issue found, document the following:

1. **Description** - What is the issue?
2. **Steps to Reproduce** - How can someone else reproduce the issue?
3. **Expected Behavior** - What should happen?
4. **Actual Behavior** - What actually happens?
5. **Severity** - How serious is the issue? (Low, Medium, High)
6. **Screenshots** - If applicable, include screenshots of the issue

## Example Testing Session

1. Launch the application
2. Use the **UI_Testing_Checklist.md** to systematically test each aspect of the UI
3. For each item on the checklist:
   - Test the feature
   - Check the box if it works correctly
   - Leave the box unchecked if there are issues
   - Add notes about any issues found
4. Document your findings in the **UI_Testing_Results.md** file
5. If conducting user testing, provide the tester with the **UI_Testing_Script.md** and observe them as they use the application
6. Ask the tester to complete the **UI_Testing_Feedback_Form.md** after testing

## Conclusion

Thorough testing is essential for ensuring a high-quality user experience. By following these instructions and using the provided materials, you can conduct comprehensive UI testing of the ADEPT AI Teaching Assistant application and identify areas for improvement.

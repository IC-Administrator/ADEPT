# ADEPT Test Organization and Improvement Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for organizing and improving the test structure in the ADEPT project. It addresses current issues with test organization and provides specific recommendations for enhancing test quality and coverage.

## Current State Analysis

The ADEPT project has a test structure in the `tests` directory that has been partially reorganized but still requires some refinement:

```

```

The test directories that were previously in the `src` folder have been migrated to the appropriate locations in the `tests` directory structure. However, there are still some test projects at the root of the `tests` directory that should be moved to their respective subdirectories (Unit, Integration, etc.).

## Test Organization Recommendations

### 1. Consolidate Test Directories ✅

**Previous Issue:** Tests were spread across multiple locations, creating confusion about where tests should be located.

**Implemented Solution:**
- Moved all tests from `src/Adept.Tests` to the appropriate location in the `tests` directory structure
- Specifically, moved:
  - `ResourceManagementTests.cs` → `tests/Unit/Adept.Data.Tests/Repository`
  - `TemplateManagementTests.cs` → `tests/Unit/Adept.Data.Tests/Repository`
  - `PuppeteerToolProviderTests.cs` → `tests/Unit/Adept.Services.Tests/Mcp`

### 2. Clean Up Test Directories in src ✅

**Previous Issue:** There were test directories within the `src` folder that needed to be removed.

**Implemented Solution:**
- Updated the `cleanup-test-dirs.bat` script to include `src/Adept.Tests`
- Renamed to `cleanup-legacy-tests.bat` to better reflect its purpose
- The script can now be executed to remove all test directories from the `src` folder and standalone test applications from the root directory

### 3. Standardize Test Project Structure ✅

**Previous Issue:** The test projects had placeholder folders but many were empty.

**Implemented Solution:**
- Implemented a consistent structure within each test project:
  ```
  tests/Unit/Adept.Core.Tests/
  ├── Models/                # Tests for models
  ├── Interfaces/            # Tests for interfaces
  ├── Utilities/             # Tests for utilities
  ├── TestData/              # Test data files
  └── TestConstants.cs       # Constants used in tests
  ```
- Created similar structures for other test projects based on what they're testing
- Added README.md files to each directory explaining its purpose and providing guidelines for tests

### 4. Resolve Duplicate Test Projects ✅

**Previous Issue:** There were duplicate test projects at the root of the `tests` directory and in the appropriate subdirectories.

**Implemented Solution:**
- Migrated the `CoreConfigurationTests.cs` from the root version to the Unit version
- Updated the `cleanup-legacy-tests.bat` script to remove the duplicate test projects at the root level
- Verified that the `run-tests.bat` file correctly references the tests in their new locations

### 5. Complete Missing Test Projects

**Current Issue:** Some test projects mentioned in documentation don't exist or are incomplete.

**Recommendation:**
- Create any missing test projects mentioned in the documentation
- Ensure all test projects have proper references to the projects they're testing
- Update the solution file to include all test projects

### 6. Improve Test Utilities ✅

**Previous Issue:** The test utilities project had good foundations but could be expanded. There was also a `.new` version of the project file that contained different dependencies.

**Implemented Solution:**
- Reviewed the differences between the current and `.new` versions of the project file
- Determined that the current version is more comprehensive and should be kept
- Removed the `.new` file to avoid confusion

**Remaining Recommendations:**
- Enhance the `MockFactory` to support all services in the application
- Add more test data generators for all model types
- Create additional assertion extensions for common test scenarios
- Implement more test fixtures for different testing scenarios

## Test Implementation Recommendations

### 1. Increase Test Coverage

**Current Issue:** Test coverage appears to be limited, with many empty test folders.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement unit tests for all repositories, starting with the newly created ones
- Add tests for core models and their validation
- Create tests for service implementations
- Implement integration tests for database operations
- Add UI tests using a UI testing framework

### 2. Standardize Test Naming and Structure

**Current Issue:** Test naming and structure may be inconsistent.

**Recommendation:**
- Adopt a consistent naming convention: `[MethodName]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedResult]`
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern consistently
- Group tests by feature and class
- Use descriptive test names that explain the behavior being tested

### 3. Implement Test Data Generation

**Current Issue:** Test data creation may be inconsistent or duplicated.

**Recommendation:**
- Create factory methods for generating test data
- Use the `TestDataGenerator` class for all test data
- Create realistic test data that covers edge cases
- Avoid hardcoded test data in test methods

### 4. Add Test Documentation

**Current Issue:** Test documentation is limited.

**Recommendation:**
- Add XML documentation to test classes and methods
- Create a test plan document that outlines test coverage goals
- Document test fixtures and their usage
- Add comments explaining complex test scenarios

### 5. Implement Continuous Integration

**Current Issue:** It's unclear if tests are run automatically.

**Recommendation:**
- Set up CI/CD to run tests automatically
- Configure test reporting to track test coverage
- Add code coverage analysis
- Implement test result visualization

   - Created the `IDatabaseProvider` interface in the `Adept.Data.Database` namespace
   - Implemented `SqliteDatabaseProvider` class that implements the interface
   - Added service registration extension method for the database services

### Migrated CalendarIntegrationTest to Proper Test Structure ✅

The standalone `CalendarIntegrationTest` console application in the root directory has been migrated to the proper test structure:

1. Created a new `Adept.Services.Integration.Tests` project in the `tests/Integration` directory
2. Implemented proper integration tests for Google Calendar API in `Calendar/GoogleCalendarIntegrationTests.cs`
3. Added appropriate configuration files and documentation
4. Updated the solution file to include the new integration test project
5. The original `CalendarIntegrationTest` folder has been removed

### Migrated RecurringEventTest to Proper Test Structure ✅

The standalone `RecurringEventTest` console application in the root directory has been migrated to the proper test structure:

1. Added recurring event tests to the `Adept.Services.Integration.Tests` project in the `tests/Integration` directory
2. Implemented proper integration tests for recurring events in `Calendar/RecurringEventIntegrationTests.cs`
3. Added tests for various recurring event patterns (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
4. Added tests for event reminders and other advanced features
5. The original `RecurringEventTest` folder has been removed

### Updated Batch Files for Test Organization ✅

The batch files in the root directory have been updated to reflect the new test organization:

1. Updated `tests/run-tests.bat` to include the new `Adept.Services.Integration.Tests` project
2. Added instructions for running specific integration tests by category
3. Created `cleanup-legacy-tests.bat` (renamed from `cleanup-test-dirs.bat`) to clean up legacy test directories
4. Added entries for the standalone test applications we've migrated (`CalendarIntegrationTest` and `RecurringEventTest`)

These changes ensure that the Adept.Data project can be built successfully, which is a prerequisite for running the tests.

## Resolved Issues

### Duplicate Test Projects ✅

There were duplicate test projects at the root of the `tests` directory and in the subdirectories:

1. `tests/Adept.Core.Tests` and `tests/Unit/Adept.Core.Tests`
2. `tests/Adept.Data.Tests` and `tests/Unit/Adept.Data.Tests`
3. `tests/Adept.Services.Tests` and `tests/Unit/Adept.Services.Tests`
4. `tests/Adept.UI.Tests` and `tests/Unit/Adept.UI.Tests`

These issues have been resolved by:

1. Migrating the `CoreConfigurationTests.cs` from the root version to the Unit version
2. Updating the `cleanup-legacy-tests.bat` script to remove the duplicate test projects at the root level
3. Ensuring that the `run-tests.bat` file correctly references the tests in their new locations

### Pending Changes in Test Utilities ✅

There was a `.new` version of the `Adept.TestUtilities.csproj` file that contained different package references and project references:

1. The current version included additional package references:
   - Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
   - Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
   - Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Console

2. The current version included additional project references:
   - Adept.Data.csproj
   - Adept.Services.csproj

After reviewing the differences, we determined that the current version is more comprehensive and should be kept. The `.new` file has been removed.

## Conclusion

Implementing this test organization and improvement plan will significantly enhance the quality and maintainability of the ADEPT project. By consolidating tests into a single, well-organized structure and improving test coverage, the project will be more robust and easier to maintain.

The plan provides a clear roadmap for addressing current issues and implementing best practices for testing. By following this plan, the ADEPT project will benefit from improved code quality, reduced bugs, and easier maintenance.

The test organization has been significantly improved by migrating tests from the `src` directory to the appropriate locations in the `tests` directory structure. The next steps involve fixing the build errors in the Adept.Data project and implementing the remaining recommendations in this plan.
